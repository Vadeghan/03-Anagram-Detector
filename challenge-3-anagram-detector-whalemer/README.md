# Challenge #3 - Anagram Detector

## Overview
> Write a function in your favorite programming language that will accept any two strings as parameters and return True if they are anagrams and False if they are not.

In other words, your program must compare two passed strings to check if all the letters in one are also in the other

#### Input:
A single word given as a string consisting of only lowercase letter characters without any punctuation

#### Output:
The program should output a boolean value - True if both strings contain the same letters and False if they don't.

#### Examples:
```
is_anagram("anagram", "nagaram") => True
is_anagram("green", "egern") => True
is_anagram("abcd", "abcd") => True
is_anagram("egg", "bacon") => False
```

## Extension
See if you can make the same function again, but this time, where it takes two integers instead of two strings
